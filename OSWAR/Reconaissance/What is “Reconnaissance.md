# What is â€œReconnaissance"?

Tags: Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the smart contracts or decentralized applications (dApps) being targeted, including the contract address, ABI, and API endpoints. This information is then used to identify potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited during an attack.

During this stage, the attacker actively probes and scans the target's systems or network to identify vulnerabilities and gather information for a potential attack. Port scanning tools may be used to identify open ports on the target's system or network. DNS reconnaissance may be performed to gather information on the target's domain names and associated IP addresses.

The techniques used by malicious parties to gather data that can be utilized to help target an organization are referred to as "reconnaissance." Surveillance and gathering details on the target organization's infrastructure, personnel, or staff may be included. The adversary can then use this knowledge to its advantage in various stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as understanding how the organization maintains its operations and its current security procedures.

The malicious party would be planning and carrying out Initial Access to gain access to the internal network and defining and prioritizing post-compromise goals to determine what objectives it wants to achieve.
