# What is “Persistence”?

Tags: Persistence

Persistence consists of techniques malicious parties use to keep their access to networks and protocols across attempted actions to keep them out—changed credentials, network changes, and other interruptions that could cut off their access. Any access, action, or configuration modifications that enable them to keep a firm grip on systems, such as swapping out or hijacking programs or including startup code, are considered persistence techniques.

In the context of Web3 and blockchain, persistence can be a critical issue. These systems are designed to be decentralized and trustless, meaning that they rely on cryptographic protocols and smart contracts to ensure their integrity and security. However, if attackers gain persistent access to a Web3 or blockchain network, they could subvert these protocols and compromise the system's integrity.

Some of the specific techniques that attackers may use to establish persistence in a Web3 or blockchain environment include:

1. Exploiting logic vulnerabilities in smart contracts: Smart contracts are self-executing programs that run on a blockchain. They can be vulnerable to various attacks, including buffer overflow and integer overflow attacks. An attacker who successfully exploits a logic vulnerability in a DApp could gain persistent access to multiple parts or funds of the DApp.
2. Compromising blockchain nodes: Blockchain nodes are the distributed computer network that maintains the blockchain ledger. If an attacker can compromise one or more nodes, they may be able to gain persistent access to the blockchain network and potentially modify the entire ledger itself.
    
    In the case of PoW cryptocurrencies, getting enough mining/hash power (51%) would give that entity control to subvert and control the entire blockchain, potentially leading to a 51% attack and a fork of the entire blockchain. 
    
3. Installing malware on user devices: Users of Web3 and blockchain systems typically interact with the network using a web browser or specialized software. If an attacker can install malware on a user's device, they may be able to gain persistent access to the network by having compromised a key contributor to the network itself.
