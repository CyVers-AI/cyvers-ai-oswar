# Mitigation

Web3 technology is constantly evolving, which brings new security challenges. DApp developers should follow security best practices when coding contracts, conduct thorough code audits, and implement multi-signature mechanisms for critical functions. Additionally, users should only use trusted applications audited and reviewed by the community.

Real-time monitoring can be implemented to prevent the entire ownership of the contract from taking place by alerting the DApp/protocol in real-time and even front-running the entire transaction by detecting it in the mempool. By combining real-time monitoring with other security best practices, developers can create a comprehensive security strategy to protect against a wide range of attacks in web3.

It is important to follow secure development practices for smart contracts and dApps, such as conducting thorough security reviews and testing, implementing access controls, using secure coding practices, and monitoring and responding to suspicious activity. 

Real-time monitoring can be a powerful tool in preventing the deployment of malicious contracts in web3, by detecting anomalous behavior, identifying vulnerabilities, alerting security teams, tracking changes, and triggering automated responses.

By following these best practices, developers can reduce the risks of getting hacked.
