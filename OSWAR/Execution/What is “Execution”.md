# What is “Execution”?

Tags: Execution

Execution refers to the methods attackers use to run malware or malicious code and carry out active exploitation techniques on local or remote systems to achieve broader objectives such as network exploration, data theft, or monetary gain. Within the context of Web3, execution can encompass a wide range of attack vectors and exploit techniques specifically tailored to decentralized environments, including blockchain networks and smart contracts.

Attackers may utilize private keys obtained during the initial access phase to deploy malicious smart contracts, interact with existing contracts, or manipulate user wallets and resources. They may also use known vulnerabilities in smart contracts or decentralized applications (dApps) to execute unauthorized transactions, create backdoors, or compromise user data.

Moreover, execution in the Web3 landscape can involve abusing decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, tokenization platforms, and other Web3 services. Exploits may include flash loan attacks, reentrancy attacks, or oracle manipulation, which allow attackers to profit from poorly designed or insecure smart contracts and protocols.

By incorporating Web3-specific execution techniques alongside traditional approaches, attackers can effectively adapt their tactics to the unique characteristics of decentralized systems, making the execution phase a crucial component in the exploitation process. This enables attackers to conduct a wide range of attacks targeting Web3 ecosystems, ultimately impacting the security and integrity of these systems and their users.
