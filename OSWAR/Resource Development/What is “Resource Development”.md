# What is “Resource Development”?

Tags: Resource Development

Resource development involves creating or acquiring the necessary tools and resources for an attack, such as exploit code (malicious smart contracts), phishing scams, or social engineering tactics to move to the next attack phase.

The term "Resource Development" refers to strategies in which malicious actors create, acquire, or steal resources that can be used to aid in the hacking process. These resources can support various stages of the attack life cycle. Resource development involves identifying, gathering, or creating tools, techniques, and infrastructure necessary for an attack.

Some specific tools that can be used to carry out these tactics include:

- Metasploit: an open-source framework that can create and test exploits on a target's computer or network.
- Maltego: a tool used for data mining and information gathering. It can collect information on a target's Web3 wallets or other cryptocurrency-related accounts.
- Keylogger Pro: commercial keylogging software that can record keystrokes on a target's computer.
- Burp Suite: a web application security testing tool to identify vulnerabilities in Web3 platforms and applications.
- Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET): an open-source tool for creating and executing social engineering attacks.
