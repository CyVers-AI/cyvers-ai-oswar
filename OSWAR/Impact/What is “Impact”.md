# What is “Impact”?

Tags: Impact

Impact refers to methods malicious parties use to disrupt availability or compromise integrity by manipulating infrastructure operational processes. These techniques can include destroying or tampering with data. In some cases, processes may appear normal but could have been altered to benefit the adversaries’ goals. Malicious parties may use these methods to pursue their goals or to provide cover for a confidentiality breach.

The Impact category refers to the effects of an attack or vulnerability on an organization's systems, data, or operations. These categories include Integrity, Availability, Confidentiality, and Attribution.

In the context of Web3, Integrity is an important aspect of Impact. Smart contracts are self-executing code that runs on blockchain networks and is a central feature of many Web3 applications. A vulnerability in a smart contract could allow an attacker to modify or manipulate the state of the contract, potentially leading to financial loss or other negative consequences. Ensuring the integrity of Web3 applications and the smart contracts that underpin them is critical to maintaining trust in decentralized systems.

Availability is another aspect of Impact that is relevant to Web3. Decentralized applications and networks rely on a large number of nodes to maintain their operations. An attack that disrupts the availability of these nodes could render a Web3 application or network unusable. Ensuring the availability of Web3 systems is critical to maintaining their usefulness and ensuring their adoption.

Finally, the Attribution aspect of Impact is relevant to Web3 systems because of their decentralized and pseudonymous nature. Web3 applications and networks are designed to operate without central authorities or intermediaries, and transactions are often conducted pseudonymously. This can make it difficult to attribute the source of an attack or vulnerability. Ensuring that Web3 systems provide adequate mechanisms for verifying the identity of users and transactions is critical to maintaining security and accountability in decentralized systems.
