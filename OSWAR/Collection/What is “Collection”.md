# What is “Collection”?

Tags: Collection

The "Collection" phase involves gathering information about the targeted smart contract or decentralized application (dApp), such as the contract logic, dependencies, and user behaviors. This information is then used to refine the attack plan and increase the chances of success. It is important to note that the Collection phase is not intended to detect vulnerabilities, as that falls under the "Reconnaissance" phase.

In addition to legitimate information gathering, "Collection" also refers to the malicious collection and aggregation of sensitive data from various sources, including blockchain transactions, smart contract interactions, and user activity on dApps.

During the collection stage, attackers seek to gather the information that is already public or otherwise accessible without unauthorized access. For example, data can be collected by analyzing public blockchain transactions or scraping information from websites that publicly display Web3 application data. "Collection" and "Reconnaissance" refer to different stages in the cyberattack lifecycle within the Web3 framework.

"Collection" tactics employed by malicious actors can include the aggregation of data obtained from multiple sources, and the sources themselves can include individuals, organizations, and decentralized applications (dApps). At its core, the "collection" stage is about obtaining data and utilizing various techniques to gather information, which can then be used for a variety of purposes, such as planning attacks, targeted phishing, or gaining unauthorized access to systems.
