# Mitigation

Tags: Collection

To minimize the risk of data "collection", it is crucial to ensure that sensitive information is not publicly disclosed. Developers of decentralized applications sometimes commit and post changes to code and/or bug fixes on GitHub, which can inadvertently expose sensitive data to the web. For example, it may reveal a bug before it has been patched. This was the case with the Wormhole bridge, as mentioned by The Verge and reported in the Cyvers Web3 Security Report.

In conclusion, it may not be possible to completely prevent data collection since the information is transparent and publicly available. However, it is essential to ensure that sensitive information is kept private, making it more difficult for hackers to carry out their tactics.
