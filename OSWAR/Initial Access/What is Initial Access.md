# What is Initial Access?

Tags: Initial Access

Techniques that use different entry vectors to establish a foothold inside a network are considered initial access. The first step in exploiting a smart contract or dApp is to gain initial access, which can be achieved through various methods such as exploiting vulnerabilities, stealing private keys or deploying malware. This phase is known as "initial access," marking the beginning of the Exploitation phase. Targeted phishing strategies and taking advantage of vulnerabilities on servers, smart contracts, wallets, and credentials are some methods used to establish a foothold. Footholds acquired during the preparation phase are then used to initiate access to the network or organization.

**Example of Initial Access**

---

1. Credential Theft: Hackers may attempt to steal login credentials or private keys to gain initial access to a Web3 network or platform. This can be done through phishing attacks, social engineering, or exploiting vulnerabilities in wallets or other cryptocurrency-related accounts.
2. API Vulnerabilities: Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) connect different Web3 platforms and applications. However, if these APIs are not properly secured, they may contain vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit to gain initial access to a Web3 network or platform.

Here are some specific examples of vulnerabilities or tactics that could be employed to gain initial access to a Web3 network or platform:

- Taking advantage of unpatched server vulnerabilities, such as those related to Apache Struts or Microsoft Exchange Server.
- Using brute-force attacks to crack weak login credentials or private keys.
- Exploiting weaknesses in APIs used to connect different Web3 platforms or applications, such as those related to API keys or authentication tokens.
- Using social engineering tactics to deceive users into revealing their login credentials or private keys.
- Using malware to infect targeted computers or servers.
