# 3 STAGES of an attack with the MITRE framework

**Preparation Phase:**

1. Reconnaissance: This category involves gathering information about the target system or network, such as the IP addresses, domain names, employee names, and network architecture, to identify potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited during the attack.
2. Resource Development: This category involves creating or acquiring the tools and resources needed for the attack, such as malware, exploit kits, phishing emails, or social engineering tactics.
3. Collection: This category involves collecting additional information about the target system or network, such as the software versions, system configurations, or user behaviors, to refine the attack plan and maximize the chances of success.
4. Initial Access: This category involves gaining the first foothold into the target system or network, using various methods such as exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities, stealing credentials, or using social engineering tactics.

Compared to the Exploitation and Post Exploit phases, the Preparation phase focuses on gathering information, creating tools, and establishing initial access to the target system, which sets the stage for the more aggressive and damaging attacks that follow.

**Exploitation Phase:**

1. Discovery: This category involves identifying the targets and resources within the target network that can be exploited or attacked, such as vulnerable services, user accounts, or sensitive data.
2. Execution: This category involves running malicious code or exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access or control over the target system or network.
3. Persistence: This category involves establishing a persistent presence on the target system or network, such as by creating backdoors, installing rootkits, or modifying system settings.
4. Privilege Escalation: This category involves elevating the attacker's privileges on the target system or network, such as by exploiting vulnerabilities in software or abusing weak authentication mechanisms.
5. Defense Evasion: This category involves avoiding or bypassing the security controls and detection mechanisms of the target system or network, such as by using obfuscation techniques, hiding malicious activities within legitimate processes, or exploiting weaknesses in security software.
6. Credential Access: This category involves stealing or obtaining valid user credentials to expand access within the target network or system, such as by using brute force attacks, stealing passwords, or intercepting network traffic.
7. Lateral Movement: This category involves moving laterally within the target network or system, in search of additional targets or valuable data, such as by using stolen credentials or exploiting vulnerabilities in network services.
8. Command and Control: This category involves establishing and maintaining remote control of the compromised systems or network, such as by setting up a command-and-control infrastructure, hiding C2 traffic within legitimate protocols, or using encryption to obfuscate C2 traffic.

The Exploitation Phase involves actively attacking and compromising the target system or network, using various methods to gain access, control, and persistence, and move laterally within the target network.

**Post Exploit / Money Laundering Phase:**

1. Exfiltration: This category involves stealing or exfiltrating data from the target system or network, such as by using covert channels, hiding data within legitimate protocols, or using cloud storage services to store stolen data.
2. Impact: This category involves causing damage or disruption to the target system or network, such as by deleting or modifying data, disrupting critical services, or launching ransomware attacks.

The Post Exploit / Money Laundering Phase involves stealing valuable data, causing damage or disruption, and covering up the tracks of the attack, often through money laundering or other forms of obfuscation.
