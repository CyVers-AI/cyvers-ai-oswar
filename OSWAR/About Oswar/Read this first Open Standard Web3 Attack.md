# Read this first: Open Standard Web3 Attack Reference (OSWAR)

**A New Open Standard For Securing Web3; A comprehensive, systematic and actionable way to understand attacker behaviours and techniques concerning Web3 decentralized applications.** 

Cyvers has created the “**OSWAR**”, a globally accessible Web3 cybersecurity database of Web3 hacks, tactics, smart contract vulnerabilities, attacks frameworks and more. 

Inspired by MITRE ATT&CK®, “**OSWAR**” is meant to be a knowledge base to increase the awareness of Web3 security while collaborating with other organizations to improve on the frameworks. 

MITRE's ATT&CK framework is a widely used tool for categorizing and understanding the impact of cyber attacks and vulnerabilities. While the framework was not originally designed with Web3 and blockchain technology in mind, its general Impact subcategories can still be applied to these decentralized systems. 

DeFi and Web3 is slowly becoming a foundation for the future technology and with it comes the increased demands to keep networks, assets and infrastructures secure.

- All subcategories have the following format:
