# What is “Privilege Escalation”?

Tags: Privilege Escalation

Privilege Escalation comprises of techniques malicious parties use to gain higher-level permissions on a protocol or network. Malicious parties can often enter and explore a network with unprivileged access but require elevated permissions to follow through on their objectives. Common approaches are to take advantage of system weaknesses and misconfiguration in logic and smart contract vulnerabilities. 

Examples of elevated access include:

- Private Key access, full or semi SYSTEM/root/Admin level
- Multi-sig Private Key access, whole SYSTEM/root/Admin level
- a user account or wallet with admin-like access
- user accounts/wallets with access to specific systems or perform a specific function.

These techniques often overlap with Persistence.
