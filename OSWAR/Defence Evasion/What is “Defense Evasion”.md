# What is “Defense Evasion”?

Tags: Defense Evasion

Defense evasion refers to strategies malicious parties use to stay undetected while compromising or hacking. Defense evasion methods commonly include removing or disabling security software and obscuring/encrypting data and scripts. In the Web3 world, it comprises hiding your traces by using mixing services such as Tornado Cash. To conceal and disguise themselves, the malicious parties also take advantage of trusted processes and abuse them.

Defense Evasion does NOT belong to any stage of the Web3 hack. It is a part of almost all Web3 hacks and involves:

- Hiding the connection to other wallets
- Hiding one's own identity
- Hiding the trace of funds
- Hiding where the funds will go after a hack.

Essentially, the hacker's goal is to take the profits and be able to use them while having his identity un-compromised and having the funds laundered.

A hacker will use mixer services before and after a hack is initiated.

The money laundering process takes part at the start and end of the lifecycle of an attack, but, in the end, after a successful attack, it is the most crucial step of defense evasion & money laundering.
