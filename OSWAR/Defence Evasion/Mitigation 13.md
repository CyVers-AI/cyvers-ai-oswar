Tags: Defense Evasion

Defending against Defense Evasion is not entirely possible, but mitigating or countering these techniques can lessen the risk. To achieve this, organizations require monitoring tools, technical controls, user education, and collaboration with law enforcement. Countering defense evasion techniques involves decrypting encryption or finding the hacker's wallet or identity, even when they use defense evasion techniques to hide it.

To mitigate defense evasion in Web3, organizations can use a combination of technical controls, analysis of blockchain data, and collaboration with law enforcement. For mixing services, defenders can monitor nodes that block blacklisted wallets, while for obfuscation, they can use code analysis tools, whitelisting, and regular updates. Additionally, defenders should monitor network traffic and collaborate with law enforcement agencies to prevent encryption from hiding tracks during a hack. Defenders can monitor network traffic, identify transaction patterns, analyze blockchain data, and collaborate with law enforcement agencies for chain hopping. Implementing these mitigation strategies can help organizations reduce the risk of data breaches, fraud, and other security incidents caused by defense evasion techniques in Web3.
