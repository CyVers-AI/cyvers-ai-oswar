# What is “Exfiltration”?

Tags: Exfiltration

Exfiltration is a term used to describe the methods that attackers use to steal and conceal data from a network. Once the attackers have gathered the data, they often take steps to package it, which can include encryption and compression, to hide or erase it.

Defence Evasion, a relevant concept throughout the lifecycle of a hack, is essentially the same thing as exfiltration in Web3.

In Web2, exfiltration usually involves data, while in Web3, it often involves assets.

Typically, methods for extracting data from a target network involve sending it across the command and control channel or another channel. Sometimes there are size restrictions on the transmission. In the case of Web3, this may involve stealing cryptocurrency or other digital assets from a compromised wallet or exchange. The attacker may use various techniques, such as encrypting the stolen data, disguising it as harmless traffic, or using covert channels to avoid detection while exfiltrating the data.
