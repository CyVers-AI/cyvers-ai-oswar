Tags: Exfiltration

Mitigating or countering exfiltration techniques requires a combination of monitoring tools, technical controls, user education, and collaboration with law enforcement. Countering means being able to decrypt the encryption or find out the hacker's wallet or identity, even if the hacker uses defense evasion techniques to hide it.

To prevent encryption from concealing tracks during or after a hack, defenders should monitor network traffic and collaborate with law enforcement agencies. KYC could be implemented on exchanges that accept Monero or Atomic swaps. Additionally, regulators can impose stricter regulations on cryptocurrency exchanges and other financial institutions to prevent using atomic swaps for illicit purposes.
