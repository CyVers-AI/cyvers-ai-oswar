# What is “lateral movement”?

Tags: Lateral Movement

Malicious actors can access and control remote systems connected to a network using tactics known as lateral movement. In this scenario, the attacker is "moving" through the network, exploring and discovering their target to gain access to it later. This tactic is often necessary for malicious actors to carry out their primary aim, and they frequently switch between multiple systems and accounts to achieve their goal. To perform the lateral movement, adversaries may install their own remote access tools or use valid credentials with stealthier native networks and operating system capabilities.

In the context of Web3 systems, lateral movement is a relevant category of attack because many blockchain networks and decentralized applications are interconnected. This interconnectedness means that an attacker who gains access to one system may be able to pivot to other connected systems and potentially gain access to valuable assets.

For example, an attacker who gains access to a vulnerable smart contract on one blockchain network may be able to exploit that access to compromise a user's wallet on another connected blockchain network. This could result in cryptocurrency theft or other valuable assets, such as NFTs. Additionally, an attacker who gains access to a node on one blockchain network may leverage that access to compromise other nodes or smart contracts on the same or connected networks.
