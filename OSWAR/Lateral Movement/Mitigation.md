# Mitigation

Tags: Lateral Movement

Lateral movement refers to exploits that involve moving across multiple chains or within a network. To prevent multi-chain attacks, strong access controls, network segmentation, regular security audits, and blockchain-specific security solutions can be implemented. Compromised nodes can be mitigated through regular updates, strong passwords, limited access, and a defense-in-depth approach. Bridge exploits can be prevented by securing both ends of the bridge, implementing secure smart contracts, using multi-signature wallets, and monitoring for suspicious activity. It is important to have a response plan in place to address any potential breaches quickly.

By implementing these measures, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of lateral movement attacks and protect their Web3 infrastructure.
