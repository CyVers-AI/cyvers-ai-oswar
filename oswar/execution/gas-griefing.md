# Gas Griefing ?
Gas griefing attack happens when a user sends the amount of gas required to execute the target smart contract, but not its sub calls.Gas griefing attacks can occur on Contracts that take in data and utilize it in a sub-call to a different Contract. If this sub-call doesn't succeed, the entire transaction might either be reverted back or execution might continue. This can be particularly problematic for a relayer contract. In this case, the individual who carries out the transaction, known as the 'forwarder', can essentially block transactions by allocating just enough gas for the transaction to be executed, but not providing sufficient gas for the sub-call to be successful.

## Mitigations
Following are some options to Mitigate the Gas Griefing Issue.
- Only allow trusted users to relay transactions.
- Require that the forwarder provides enough gas.
- Perform gasEstimations before doing the transaction to the subcontract.

It is to be noted that Gas Griefing are difficult to mitigate since the gasEstimations can get wrong if transaction costs are high on the EVM.
